        <p>
          The first and last meal of a lifetime. One meal. World renowned chefs.
          Four guests. Gone forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Darkest Supper is a once in a lifetime culinary experience for
          four exclusive guests, dining in an undisclosed location.<br />
          <br />
          Gathering together a degustation menu prepared by world renowned
          chefs, those partaking at the Darkest Supper will feed on meals that
          have never been created before and will never taste again.<br />
          <br />
          The four Darkest Supper guests, when chosen, will be taken to a
          secluded forest location. The guests will have their senses blocked
          until they arrive at their destination – an architecturally designed
          cabin made from sustainable materials.<br />
          <br />
          There, they will surrender their electronic devices and sign a
          Non-Disclosure Agreement. They may never reveal the tastes and
          textures of the meal, the identities of their dining companions, or
          the recipes that lay before them.<br />
          <br />
          After the conclusion of the meal, diners and chefs will partake in
          razing the cabin and all its contents to the ground – so Mother Earth
          can claim back what is rightfully hers.
